Data structure persistance

Per edge? Then we can invalidate each edge as needed.

What situations actually lead to invalidation:

- Deleting a sketch
- Adding/removing vertices
  - This is similar to split edge/merge edges, so the data model working on edges makes sense.

Keep original sketches and any intermediate mesh state separate.

When a vertex is added, any interactions with the edge need to be recomputed.
When a vertex is removed, any interactions with both edges connected to it need to be recomputed.
